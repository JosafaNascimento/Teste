Question 2: 
A new category was created called PEP (politically exposed person). 
Also, a new bool property IsPoliticallyExposed was created in the ITrade interface. 
A trade shall be categorized as PEP if IsPoliticallyExposed is true. 
Describe in at most 1 paragraph what you must do in your design to account for this new category.

We need to create a new class PEP like categories EXPIRED,HIGHRISK and MEDIUMRISK and include the bool validation "IsPoliticallyExposed"
